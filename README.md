Ahoy ⛵ there!

A journey of over 14 years, where I've danced 💃 through the labyrinth of customer centricity, wearing the hat 🤠 of support and success leadership for some amazing orgs. If you've ever thought customer handling is an art, well, I've practically been Picasso! 🎨🖌️

But hold your horses 🐎, as my compass 🧭 is pointing to new stars ⭐. Ever heard of a seasoned customer centric virtuoso turning into a tech aficionado? That's me! Armed with curiosity and a problem solving mindset, I'm diving headfirst into the tech world.

Now, here comes the twist: I wasn't just steering the ship; I helped build it. With over a decade spent sculpting startups, I've been in the trenches as a Co-Founder, heading Sales, Retention, Growth and Support. Those entrepreneurial stripes aren't just for show – they've nurtured a strategic beast within me 😅

Championing change is my modus operandi. Why switch gears now, you ask? Well, because dreams don't have an expiry date! And I like to believe its never to late to follow your dream 😎

Let's talk strategy. My journey isn't just a rollercoaster 🎢; it's an entire theme park 🎪. I'm not just learning, I'm embracing the tech world with arms wide open 👐, ready to crack real world problems with the magic of coding ⌨️

Speaking of magic 🪄, I've always believed in the spellbinding power of resilience. Hurdles in life are mere ingredients for the potion of growth 🚀. I'm not just stepping 🪜 into tech; I'm conjuring a symphony 🎹 of innovation.

So, what's my vision? It's a fusion of dream and will. If you're into solving real world problems through an innovative product, and need a tech-head, I am your guy! 👨‍💻
